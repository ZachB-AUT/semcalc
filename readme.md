# Overview
This program is designed to take a list of classes at auckland university of
technology, and find a combination which meets requirements (ie. No conflicts)
It then ranks combinations based on several factors, such as the presence of
0800 classes, or having days off, and presents these options to the user.

I wrote this because arion is a pain in the ass.

# Future Directions
Ideally I would like this to be a replacement for using arion or myaut to
create class combinations. This means making it more reliable/user friendly.

# Todo
## User Interface
- [ ] Make easier to use, format outputs better.
- [ ] Add user input of coursecodes
- [ ] Terminal User Interface (curses?)
- [ ] Allow for searching for courses by name, instead of course code
    - [ ] Fuzzy searching?

## Technical Capability
- [ ] Incorporate webscraper
    - [ ] Make webscraper more reliable
    - [ ] Scrape course prescriptors
    - [ ] Automatically check for course changes
- [ ] Autosave schedules
- [ ] Allow for planning classes over several semesters (Multiple years?)
